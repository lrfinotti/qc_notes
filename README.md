# Quantum Computing Notes


Notes for Quantum Computing containing mainly short definitions and results, only with sporadic details.  Based on videos, such as [
Quantum Computing Course – Math and Theory for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsbCSkvHhMo&t=2690s) and [Erdős Institute](https://www.erdosinstitute.org) Fall 2025 [Quantum Computing Bootcamp](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/programs/fall-2025/quantum-computing-boot-camp).

**Note:** These are quick notes and likely full of typos and mistakes (at least until I have the time to go over them more carefully), so be careful!  *Corrections and suggestions are welcome!*
